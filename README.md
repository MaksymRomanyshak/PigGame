# PigGame

The game has two players, and each player takes turns rolling a dice. The player accumulates points for each roll, and can choose to "hold" and keep their points or "roll" again to try to accumulate more points. If a player rolls a "1" on the dice, they lose all their points for that turn and the next player takes their turn. The first player who reaches 100 points wins the game.
